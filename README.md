Enterprise information security risk register project using GRC methodologies
# Enterprise Risk Register – GRC Project

This repository contains an enterprise information security risk register developed for a mock FinTech organization operating in a cloud-based environment.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project was to identify, assess, and manage key cybersecurity, operational, and compliance-related risks using standard Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) practices.

The risk register supports structured risk prioritization, accountability, and ongoing risk monitoring across security and business functions.

## Organization Context
- Industry: FinTech / Digital Payments
- Environment: Cloud-based infrastructure
- Data Types: Customer personal data, transaction metadata, internal business information
- Organization Size: ~150 employees (mock)

## Scope
### In Scope
- Information security and operational risks
- Cloud security and identity management
- Third-party vendor risk
- Incident response readiness
- Compliance and data protection

### Out of Scope
- Penetration testing or exploitation
- Financial risk modeling
- Legal or regulatory filing activities

## Risk Methodology
- Likelihood rated from 1 (Low) to 5 (High)
- Impact rated from 1 (Low) to 5 (High)
- Risk Score calculated as Likelihood × Impact
- Risk states tracked: Inherent, Current, and Residual risk

## Files Included
- Enterprise Risk Register Project Description (PDF)
- Risk Register with risk scoring, ownership, and mitigation tracking (Excel)

## Key Learnings
- Enterprise risk assessment and prioritization
- GRC documentation and governance workflows
- Risk ownership, escalation, and lifecycle tracking
- Intersection of SOC operations, cloud security, and compliance risks
